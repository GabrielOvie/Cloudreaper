## 🎯 Why CloudReaper?

### The Problem

* **67% of startups** exceed their planned cloud budget in the first quarter
* **Average overspend:** 340% of initial estimates
* **Root cause:** Lack of structured cost governance

### The Solution

CloudReaper enables FinOps via **cost policy as code** — version-controlled, testable, and collaborative.

```yaml
# Example: Lean startup policy
name: "TechStartup Cost Policy"
extends: "templates/lean-startup"

rules:
  - name: "Development Shutdown"
    resources: ["ec2", "rds"]
    schedule: "weekends-off"
    idle_threshold: "7d"
    estimated_savings: "£400/month"
```

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Write cost governance rules in YAML
* Version and audit your policies
* Customize via inheritance and overrides

### 🛡️ Safety First

* Full audit logs for compliance

### 📊 Intelligent Reporting
